Key Management System (KMS) - Cryptographic Module
Overview
This Python module implements a comprehensive Key Management System (KMS) that provides secure cryptographic operations including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, key generation, and key management. The system is built using the cryptography library from Python's Hazmat (Hazardous Materials) primitives, ensuring robust security implementations.

Features
Symmetric Key Management

AES-256 encryption/decryption (CBC mode)

Secure key generation using secrets module

Key storage and retrieval

Asymmetric Key Management

RSA key pair generation (2048-bit)

RSA encryption/decryption with PKCS1v15 padding

Public/private key storage

Key Exchange

Diffie-Hellman parameter and key generation (2048-bit)

Key Lifecycle Management

Secure key revocation

In-memory key storage (for demonstration purposes)

Security Considerations
Uses cryptographically secure random number generation (secrets module)

Implements proper padding schemes (PKCS7 for AES, PKCS1v15 for RSA)

Generates fresh initialization vectors (IVs) for each AES encryption

Follows best practices for key sizes:

AES-256 for symmetric encryption

RSA-2048 for asymmetric operations

DH-2048 for key exchange

Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed

Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install cryptography
Usage
Initialization
python
Copy
from kms_module import KeyCustodian

kms = KeyCustodian()
Symmetric Encryption (AES)
python
Copy
# Generate and store an AES key
key_id = "secure_channel_1"
kms.establish_aes_key(key_id)

# Encrypt data
encrypted = kms.encrypt_data_aes(key_id, "Top secret message")

# Decrypt data
decrypted = kms.decrypt_data_aes(key_id, encrypted)
Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)
python
Copy
# Generate RSA key pair
user = "alice"
kms.generate_rsa_pair(user)

# Encrypt data with public key
encrypted = kms.encrypt_data_rsa(user, "Confidential data")

# Decrypt with private key
decrypted = kms.decrypt_data_rsa(user, encrypted)
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
python
Copy
# Generate DH parameters and keys
private_key, public_key = kms.generate_diffie_hellman_params_and_key()
Key Revocation
python
Copy
# Revoke a key
result = kms.invalidate_key("secure_channel_1")
Important Notes
Production Use: This implementation stores keys in memory (dictionaries) for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would want to:

Use secure key storage solutions

Implement proper key rotation policies

Add secure key backup mechanisms

Key Protection: The current implementation doesn't encrypt stored keys. In production, you should encrypt keys-at-rest using a master key or HSM.

Error Handling: The current implementation has basic error handling. Production systems should include comprehensive error handling and logging.

Performance: RSA operations are computationally expensive. For large data, consider hybrid encryption (RSA for key exchange + AES for data encryption).

Testing
The module includes built-in test cases that demonstrate:

AES encryption/decryption cycle

RSA encryption/decryption cycle

Diffie-Hellman parameter generation

Key revocation functionality

To run the tests, simply execute the module.

Limitations
Persistence: Keys are not persisted to disk/database

Access Control: No role-based access control for keys

Audit Logging: No logging of key usage

Key Rotation: No automatic key rotation mechanism

Future Enhancements
Add support for elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA, ECDH)

Implement key versioning and rotation

Add secure key storage backend

Implement key usage audit logging

Add support for hardware security modules (HSMs)

Security Best Practices
When deploying this or any cryptographic system:

Protect Keys: Store keys securely using appropriate mechanisms

Rotate Keys: Implement regular key rotation policies

Least Privilege: Restrict access to keys based on need

Audit: Log all key usage and access

Validate: Regularly test your cryptographic implementation
